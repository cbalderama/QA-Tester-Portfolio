## About me
I am a design and functional oriented person, I prefer things to be visually appealing but also practical and efficient- and I carry that throughout my career as a Software Tester.  
I am experienced in both manual and automation testing, with strong skills in writing automation scripts and test cases.  
Having a background in software programming allows me to understand the full software development lifecycle, not just the testing phase.

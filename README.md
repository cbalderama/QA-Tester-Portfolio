## About me
I am a design oriented person, my background in mobile development and graphics design helped me to become a creative and flexible person. As a developer, I'm committed to creating functional and accessible features, while as a designer, I strive to captivate users with seamless design and graphics.

I have received my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from Sorsogon State University. I've also gained experience as an assistant specialist in Search Engine Optimization and as a Mobile Developer for a children's app under a development and humanitarian organization.

As of now, I wish to use my skills and knowledge as a developer and graphics designer in software testing.I am always expanding my skillset via technical and practical learning opportunities, ensuring I stay updated with the latest developments in the field.

It would be an honor to receive hands-on experience and knowledge in the field of software testing to reach my goal as an expert in the field.
